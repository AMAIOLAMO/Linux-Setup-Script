# Linux Setup Script
I initially wrote this script for my own purposes, targeted for the distribution Debian 12.

this installs the following packages and programs that I usually use:

1. nala
2. neovim
3. fish
4. nnn

5. timeshift
6. keepass
7. krita
8. syncthing


This also installs the FiraCode Nerd Font by downloading it temporarily into `$HOME/Downloads` folder

This also installs the (`starship`)[https://starship.rs/] cross shell prompt, and initializes the `fish` shell.

Any one can modify and use this script, I cannot care less :P
